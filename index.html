		<p>Within much of architectural education and
			 practice computers and by extension software are 
			 considered tools. Students learn to use "digital tools" to produce 
			 images of buildings as plans, sections, elevations, and renderings. Similarly, 
			 three-dimensional objects are produced through 3D printing or other means of digital
			  fabrication. When we call a computer or a piece of software a tool, we do so with 
			  the intent of carefully separating the work of the tool from the intent of the
			   designer/author. The tool is deployed by the designer to produce a specific 
			   result. The tool is little more than a facilitator. The tool is not the author.
			    At least this is the argument.</p>


				<p>There is however another way to approach the problem of
					 software in Architecture. It is to engage software as a medium in its
					  own right. To see the design and crafting of a software, program or 
					  function as a creative act in which the medium is code. This line of 
					  thinking has a long history dating back at least as far as the 1970's
					   with Alan Kay's _Smalltalk_ programming language. In the last twenty
					    years, it has been centered in the Creative Coding movement, perhaps 
						starting with John Maeda's development of the _Design by Numbers_ software/language 
						at MIT's Aesthetics and Computation group in 1996. Other examples include: _Processing_ 
						developed by Casey Reas and Benjanmin Fry, _openFrameworks_ developed by Zach Lieberman,
						 and P5.js developed by Lauren Lee McCarthy. These platforms are free and open-source.
						  Instead of designing software as a top-down product to be consumed, they design
						   software in which development and extension takes place in the community. 
						   Furthermore, all of these examples were developed as a means of allowing artists 
						   and designers to access code as creative medium. In the same way a writer learns 
						   the syntax and semantics of their given language while simultaneously learning to
						    infuse the words with creative thinking and intent, a designer or artist working 
							with code learns the technical aspects of writing code while simultaneously
							 learning to think imaginatively through code. This semester we will test this
							  paradigm by working with code as our medium. We will design programs that make
							   drawings, objects, parts of buildings, images and perhaps forms of representation
							    that we have not yet anticipated.</h5>
