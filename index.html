    <p>Within much of architectural education and practice computers and by extension software are considered tools. Students learn to use "digital tools" to produce images of buildings as plans, sections, elevations, and renderings. Similarly, three-dimensional
        objects are produced through 3D printing or other means of digital fabrication. When we call a computer or a piece of software a tool, we do so with the intent of carefully separating the work of the tool from the intent of the designer/author.
        The tool is deployed by the designer to produce a specific result. The tool is little more than a facilitator. The tool is not the author. At least this is the argument.</p>


    <p>There is however another way to approach the problem of software in Architecture. It is to engage software as a medium in its own right. To see the design and crafting of a software, program or function as a creative act in which the medium is code.
        This line of thinking has a long history dating back at least as far as the 1970's with Alan Kay's <i>Smalltalk</i> programming language. In the last twenty years, it has been centered in the Creative Coding movement, perhaps starting with John
        Maeda's development of the <i>Design by Numbers</i> software/language at MIT's Aesthetics and Computation group in 1996. Other examples include: <i>Processing</i> developed by Casey Reas and Benjanmin Fry, <i>openFrameworks</i> developed by Zach
        Lieberman and <i>P5.js</i> developed by Lauren Lee McCarthy. These platforms are free and open-source. Instead of designing software as a top-down product to be consumed, they design software in which development and extension takes place in the
        community. Furthermore, all of these examples were developed as a means of allowing artists and designers to access code as creative medium. In the same way a writer learns the syntax and semantics of their given language while simultaneously
        learning to infuse the words with creative thinking and intent, a designer or artist working with code learns the technical aspects of writing code while simultaneously learning to think imaginatively through code. This semester we will test this
        paradigm by working with code as our medium. We will design programs that make drawings, objects, parts of buildings, images and perhaps forms of representation that we have not yet anticipated.</h5>
